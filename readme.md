# DSI - 16 Capstone Project - Personality Prediction

## **Introduction**

**ABOUT MBTI:**

*The Myers-Brigg typology is based on Jung’s theory of psychological types. It was constructed by the mother and daughter team of Katherine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. Katherine Briggs had used Jungian notions of personality to analyze characters in literature.*

*Although the MBTI is based on Jungian theory, it was really Isabel Myers’ interpretation of that theory that lies beneath the test’s construction. For example, in Jung’s theory, there is no “judging-perception” dimension (J vs. P), that was a creation of Myers and Briggs.*

## **Executive Summary**

The current prevalent use of MBTI is in career advising (e.g., suggesting that Thinking types go into more structured jobs; Extraverts into “people professions,” etc.).  With a model that can predict the personality type through a candidate's short text  messages,  career advisers or recruiters can quickly access candidates based on their type on how comfortable or successful will the candidate be in a certain role, or better engage with the candidates through their preferred way of thinking and behaving (e.g. Intuition Types prefer creative, big picture, long term development in career while Sensing Types would better relate with actual facts and scope of the any given role)
